        <h3 class="font-weight-light">OBJECTIVES OF THIS <span class="font-weight-bold">BLOG</span></h3><br>
        <p><h5 class="font-weight-bold">GENERAL</h5>- To appreciate the magnitude of Godʼs generosity in the provision or creation of the trees and the plants on the third day of creations for Manʼs use and to His Glory.<br><br><h5 class="font-weight-bold">SPECIFIC</h5>- To re-generate your body.<br>- To re-focus or re-orientate your soul.<br>- To preserve your spirit towards your Eternal Home - HEAVEN.<br>NOT to turn you to an Herbalist but to make you consciously appreciate these God-given gifts which are plenty, cheap and un-tapped in your environs and then use them for your own benefits.</p>

          <blockquote>NOTE: “If there were no plants, we would not be here. We breathe in what they breathe out.” - By Keetowah Proverb which Science has proved right.
<br>
“Life is not merely being ALIVE but BEING WELL” - Marcus Valerius Martialis (40AD – 103)
          </blockquote>
          <p><h5 class="font-weight-bold">CAUSES OF DISEASES</h5>
- Failure of Man to heed to the instruction of God. Gen 1[29 and Ezekiel 47[12c. Man again disobeys the natural law of existence; hence a disharmony exists between Man and Nature - (plants and trees).<br>- While the Trinity of God (Father, Son and Spirit) remains intact, Man appears not interested in his own 3 components – Body, Soul and Spirit. In actual fact, Man only takes care of the external aspect of his body and NOT the internal aspect. How much more taking good care of the Soul and the Spirit!<br>“What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies WITHIN us.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson. Manʼs body is constantly abused by man, not keeping to the instructions of God who declared that Manʼs body is His Temple which should be kept holy. 1 Cor. 6: 19. Equally, Manʼs mind is so polluted and desperately wicked (Jer. 17[9 and Matt. 15[19) which made God to wipe off the generation of Noah. Present generation of ours has done worse things than Noahʼs generation! No wonder, Bible says Man must worship God in Spirit - (Cor. 6[17) AND man is to be holy just like his Creator – 1 Pet. 1: 16.<br>Manʼs soul is kept in ambience; quietly waiting to carry either evil or good spirit. No wonder, the Bible instructs Man to follow the Spirit of God. Gal. 5: 25. The disharmony between body, soul and spirit of Man due to severe abuse, consciously or unconsciously, has resulted into a situation where Man is dis-eased. I.e. Man is no longer at ease.
<br><br><br><h5 class="font-weight-bold">What does this mean?</h5>“A man too busy to take care of his health is like a mechanic too busy to take care of his tools.” - Spanish proverb<br><br><br>
<h5 class="font-weight-bold">PARADOXES</h5>- Man lives on the land which is fully endowed with abundance of Godʼs gifts and yet he has poor health!<br>- Nature is open to ALL for use but only a FEW of us care to observe, appreciate and make good use of these treasures.<br>- Man leaves the substance and chases shadows. Man is after FAST LIFESTYLE in the JET AGE which has brought to him untold hardship. Man has invented FAST FOOD, with FAST DISEASE and finally FAST DEATH!<br>- Our Ancestors lived long enough to see their great-grand children; some lived up to 150 years just because they were CLOSE to nature!
